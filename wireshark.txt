===== DAYTIME =====
1. TCP Handshake
    1 First part of the TCP 3-way handshake - Hey can we talk?
       1 192.168.136.128	129.6.15.29	TCP	74	60038 → 13 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM TSval=2570723559 TSecr=0 WS=128
    2 Second part of the TCP 3-way handshake - Yes let's talk, I got your message
       5 129.6.15.29	192.168.136.128	TCP	60	13 → 60038 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460
    3. Third part of the TCP 3-way handshake - I got your reply
       6 192.168.136.128	129.6.15.29	TCP	54	60038 → 13 [ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=64240 Len=0

2. The client uses port 13 for this interaction.
3. The client needs this port to communicate to the right server and makes sure that the packets reach the right server, the server the client is trying to communicate to.
4. Frame: 7 129.6.15.29	192.168.136.128	DAYTIME	105	DAYTIME Response
5. [SYN] means sychronization and this packet is sent first by the client to tell the server they want to initaize a connection. [ACK] means acknowledged and it is sent to tell the server or client (depending on who is sending the packet) that their message has been recieved.
6. The nc client initiated the closing of the TCP connection. After recieving the DAYTIME response, the client initates the closing of the TCP connection by sending a [FIN][ACK] packet to the daytime server. The Frame: 8 192.168.136.128	129.6.15.29	TCP	54	60038 → 13 [FIN, ACK] Seq=1 Ack=53 Win=64188 Len=0. Afterwards, the daytime server acknowledges that it recieved the finish command. 

=== HTTP ===

1. I believe 2 TCP connections were established. The client sends to [SYN] packets to initalize 2 commmunication pathways to cs388.jeffondich.com (server). Then the server responds with a [SYN][ACK] to acknowledge the response was recieved. Following this the client responds with an [ACK] packet to acknowledge the servers connection. But the last two steps occur twice meaning there was another [SYN][ACk] and [ACK] packet send afterwards, meaning two TCP connections were opened. 

2. Yes, the homepage was requested after the two TCP connections were opened.
7	0.016073033	192.168.136.128	172.233.221.124	HTTP	404	GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 

3. Yes, the photography was requested after the homepage was sent and recieved by the client. 
11	0.143052017	192.168.136.128	172.233.221.124	HTTP	443	GET /jeff-square-colorado.jpg HTTP/1.1 

=== QUESTIONS ====
1. When experimenting with the HTTP site after the client sends the request for the maisie-jeff.jpg, the website acknowledges that it recieves the request but then sends multiple [PSH, ACK] packs similar to the one shown below. What does the [PSH] mean? Is it sent in this format because the image was broken down into different packets and sent to the client in multiple packets?

15	0.165505640	172.233.221.124	192.168.136.128	TCP	1436	80 → 55680 [PSH, ACK] Seq=614 Ack=736 Win=64240 Len=1382 [TCP PDU reassembled in 149]


2. What does [TCP Keep-Alive] mean? An example frame is below:
156	10.354265235	192.168.136.128	172.233.221.124	TCP	54	[TCP Keep-Alive] 55664 → 80 [ACK] Seq=762 Ack=539946 Win=65535 Len=0
